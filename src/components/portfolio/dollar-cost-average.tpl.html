    Dollar-Cost Averaging
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    As you already know, asset values don't go in a straight line. One common strategy to take
    advantage of market volatility is <b>dollar-cost averaging</b> (DCA). Instead of investing all
    of your wealth into your portfolio as one lump-sum, you can instead slowly add the assets to
    your portfolio at regular intervals. The strategy works like this:
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    When the markets are up (and potentially overvalued) then you will acquire less of the assets.
    When the markets are down (and potentially undervalued) then the same amount of money will let
    you acquire more assets.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    In many cases, DCA is a strategy that is implemented naturally. For example, this can be done
    by utilizing a portion of your paycheck. Another benefit of this strategy is that it allows you
    to (at least partially) rebalance your portfolio without selling any assets, which provides a
    great advantage from a tax perspective.
