    Hedging Your Bets
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    Of course, there are sometimes long periods of economic stagnation or even contraction. Instead
    of trying to <b>time the market</b>, you can add different types of assets to your portfolio
    that will behave differently during those times. One popular choice for this purpose are
    <b>bonds</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Having a diversity of assets in your portfolio helps minimize <b>drawdowns</b> and often results
    in higher overall performance compared to holding a single class of assets, especially when
    a <b>rebalancing strategy</b> is employed.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    A very common strategy for U.S. investors is the <b>three-fund portfolio</b>. An investor
    following this strategy simply selects a combination of funds that provide exposure to three
    main categories: <b>U.S. Bonds</b>, <b>U.S. Equities</b> and <b>International Equities</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Equities (also referred to as <b>stock</b>) are considered more risky, but they also yield
    a potentially higher reward. More diversified equities (i.e. international as opposed to U.S.
    only) tend to be less volatile than their more concentrated counterparts. Lastly, bonds are
    considered extremely stable but in many cases their <b>return-on-investment</b> can be lower
    than the <b>inflation rate</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Select your desired <b>asset allocation</b> based on your investment objectives. A larger
    proportion of equities is riskier, but likely to outperform other choices in the long term
    (over 10 years).
