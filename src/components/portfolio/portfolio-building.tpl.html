    Building a Portfolio
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    In order to invest your savings, you need to build a <b>portfolio</b>. The portfolio consists of
    a series of <b>assets</b> to which funds will be allocated. Those assets can be <b>stocks</b>,
    <b>bonds</b>, and other financial instruments. Which assets are selected and the proportion of
    funds allocated to them is what makes a it portfolio.

<p class="survey-block">
    There's no one-size-fits-all strategy when building a portfolio, but there are several formulas
    that have consistently worked for a number of investment objectives. At FinMango, we are strong
    believers of long-term strategies based on <b>low-cost broad-market indices</b>.

<p class="survey-block">
    By investing in broad-market indices, your wealth will be correlated to the growth of the
    overall economy, instead of depending on the success of individual companies. Over a long enough
    period of time (at least 10 years), both the global and the U.S. economy have consistently
    experienced periods of significant growth.

    We have collected financial data dating back to 1973 and built this portfolio simulator, so you
    can see how different portfolios and strategies would have performed in a variety of economic
    conditions. Your answers to the following questions will be used to initialize the simulator
    parameters.
