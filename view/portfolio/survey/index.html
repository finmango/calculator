    Building a Portfolio
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    In order to invest your savings, you need to build a <b>portfolio</b>. The portfolio consists of
    a series of <b>assets</b> to which funds will be allocated. Those assets can be <b>stocks</b>,
    <b>bonds</b>, and other financial instruments. Which assets are selected and the proportion of
    funds allocated to them is what makes a it portfolio.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    There's no one-size-fits-all strategy when building a portfolio, but there are several formulas
    that have consistently worked for a number of investment objectives. At FinMango, we are strong
    believers of long-term strategies based on <b>low-cost broad-market indices</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    By investing in broad-market indices, your wealth will be correlated to the growth of the
    overall economy, instead of depending on the success of individual companies. Over a long enough
    period of time (at least 10 years), both the global and the U.S. economy have consistently
    experienced periods of significant growth.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    We have collected financial data dating back to 1973 and built this portfolio simulator, so you
    can see how different portfolios and strategies would have performed in a variety of economic
    conditions. Your answers to the following questions will be used to initialize the simulator
    parameters.
</p>
            </div>

            <div class="survey-screen animated">
                <h2 class="survey-header">
    Initial Investment
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    With a sufficiently long <b>investment horizon</b>, you don't need to start with a large initial
    investment to build wealth. In fact, for most people, time is a much more important factor than
    the amount initially invested!
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Another often underestimated factor is the <b>physchology</b> of investing. Particularly during
    stressing times such as recessions or market crashes. During a market downturn, the safest
    course of action is often to do nothing. This is easier said than done when you might see
    your portfolio losing, for example, half of its value.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    The difference between the highest historical value of your portfolio and the current value is
    called <b>drawdown</b>. Riskier strategies might experience a drawdown of over half of the
    portfolio value. As an investor, you should ask yourself if you would be willing to stick to the
    original investment strategy in that situation. For example, someone who invested in a fully
    diversified 100% U.S. broad-market equity index (<b>VTI</b>) in 2007, would have experienced a
    near 50% drawdown in their investments within a year:

    Hedging Your Bets
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    Of course, there are sometimes long periods of economic stagnation or even contraction. Instead
    of trying to <b>time the market</b>, you can add different types of assets to your portfolio
    that will behave differently during those times. One popular choice for this purpose are
    <b>bonds</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Having a diversity of assets in your portfolio helps minimize <b>drawdowns</b> and often results
    in higher overall performance compared to holding a single class of assets, especially when
    a <b>rebalancing strategy</b> is employed.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    A very common strategy for U.S. investors is the <b>three-fund portfolio</b>. An investor
    following this strategy simply selects a combination of funds that provide exposure to three
    main categories: <b>U.S. Bonds</b>, <b>U.S. Equities</b> and <b>International Equities</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Equities (also referred to as <b>stock</b>) are considered more risky, but they also yield
    a potentially higher reward. More diversified equities (i.e. international as opposed to U.S.
    only) tend to be less volatile than their more concentrated counterparts. Lastly, bonds are
    considered extremely stable but in many cases their <b>return-on-investment</b> can be lower
    than the <b>inflation rate</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Select your desired <b>asset allocation</b> based on your investment objectives. A larger
    proportion of equities is riskier, but likely to outperform other choices in the long term
    (over 10 years).

    Reinvesting Dividends
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    Most well-established and profitable companies distribute <b>dividends</b> to their
    shareholders. This means that, simply by owning shares of a certain company, you will be given a
    determined amount of cash for each share that you own. This is often on a quarterly basis, but
    it could also be more or less frequent depending on the company.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Many of the popular <b>exchange-traded funds</b> (ETF) that track broad-market indices
    distribute the dividends of the companies that are part of the index back to the shareholders,
    so you don't need to own stock of individual companies to benefit from those dividends.

<p class="survey-block">
    Most brokers allow you to automatically reinvest any dividends from stock you own. This allows
    you to take advantage of the <b>compounding</b> nature of investing, which can have a

    Rebalancing Strategy
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    <b>Rebalancing</b> is an extremely important concept when it comes to building a successful
    portfolio. As time passes and some of the assets in your portfolio outperform others, your
    portfolio deviates from its intended <b>asset allocation</b>.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    To overcome this problem, investors rebalance their portfolio at certain time intervals. More
    frequent rebalancing does not always yield better results, and unless automated it will also
    take up a significant amount of time and effort. Select your desired rebalancing strategy:

    Dollar-Cost Averaging
</h2>

<p class="survey-block">
    As you already know, asset values don't go in a straight line. One common strategy to take
    advantage of market volatility is <b>dollar-cost averaging</b> (DCA). Instead of investing all
    of your wealth into your portfolio as one lump-sum, you can slowly add the assets to your
    portfolio at regular intervals. The strategy works like this:
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    When the markets are up (and potentially overvalued) then $1 will purchase a smaller amount of
    assets. When the markets are down (and potentially undervalued) then the same $1 will let you
    acquire more assets.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    In many cases, DCA is a strategy that is implemented naturally. For example, this can be done
    by automatically investing a portion of your paycheck. Another benefit of this strategy is that
    it allows you to (at least partially) rebalance your portfolio without selling any assets, which
    provides a great advantage from a tax perspective.
</p>

<p class="survey-block">
    Please select your desired DCA strategy. For example, if the initial investment was $200 and you
    plan on adding $10 monthly, select a monthly schedule and then enter $10.
